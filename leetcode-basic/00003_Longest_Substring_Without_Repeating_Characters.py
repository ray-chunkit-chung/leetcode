# Leetcode solution 1
# In the naive approaches, we repeatedly check a substring to see if it has duplicate character. But it is unnecessary. If a substring s_{ij}s 
# ij
#   from index ii to j - 1jâˆ’1 is already checked to have no duplicate characters. We only need to check if s[j]s[j] is already in the substring s_{ij}s 
# ij
#  .
#         chars = [0] * 128
#         left = right = 0
#         res = 0
#         while right < len(s):
#             r = s[right]
#             chars[ord(r)] += 1

#             while chars[ord(r)] > 1:
#                 l = s[left]
#                 chars[ord(l)] -= 1
#                 left += 1

#             res = max(res, right - left + 1)

# Leetcode solution 2
# The above solution requires at most 2n steps. In fact, it could be optimized to require only n steps. Instead of using a set to tell if a character exists or not, we could define a mapping of the characters to its index. Then we can skip the characters immediately when we found a repeated character.

# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

# Constraints:

# 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
# s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
